# trivia-game
This is a project I worked on in university for a workshop when I was a part of the UNB Dev Society. It is a trivia game similar to Jeopardy.

## Getting the Project onto your Machine

To get the start-up template follow the instructions below:

* Open up the terminal for Linux and MacOS or Git Bash for Windows
* Make a directory for the workshop project in you desired location `> mkdir react-workshop`
* Clone the repo using HTTP 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmajcan/trivia-game.git
``` 
* Or if you have have SSH setup 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jmajcan/trivia-game.git
```

### Running the Application

The app we created can be run locally on your system. To do so, simply change your directory to the project and install the necessary modules.

```bash
cd trivia-game
npm i
```

Once the modules are installed you are good to go!

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will opens up the react application in a new tab of our browser with the below URL.

http://localhost:3000
